# (Obsolete) How to implement a pop-up edit form for GridView


<p>This example is obsolete. In latest versions, we suggest using built-in feature: <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/753/Controls-and-Libraries/Data-Grid/Data-Editing-and-Validation/Modify-and-Validate-Cell-Values#edit_form">Edit Form</a><br><br>This example demonstrates how to edit the row in the GridView using the pop-up form. The editors for this form are generated automatically, based on the columns' editors. Please note: this solution is intended for creating a simple layout. In more complex situations, the best approach is to create the Edit Form for each GridView in the designer, and manually place editors.</p>
